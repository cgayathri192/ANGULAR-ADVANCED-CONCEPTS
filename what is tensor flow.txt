TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It provides a wide range of tools, libraries, and resources for building and training machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks. TensorFlow is designed to be flexible and scalable, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from image and speech recognition to natural language processing and recommendation systems.

At its core, TensorFlow represents computations as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) called "TensorFlow graphs". Nodes in the graph represent operations, while edges represent data (tensors) flowing between the operations. TensorFlow provides an extensive set of APIs for defining, optimizing, and executing these computational graphs across various hardware platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), and even distributed clusters of machines.

Some of the key features of TensorFlow include automatic differentiation for gradient-based optimization, support for high-level APIs such as Keras for building deep learning models, support for various data formats, and a rich ecosystem of pre-trained models, tools, and libraries for tasks such as computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.

TensorFlow is widely used by researchers, engineers, and data scientists for a wide range of machine learning tasks, and it has a large community of users and contributors who actively develop and improve the framework. TensorFlow is available for free under the Apache 2.0 open-source license, making it accessible to anyone interested in machine learning and deep learning.
