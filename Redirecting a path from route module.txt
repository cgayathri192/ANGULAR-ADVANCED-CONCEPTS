Go to routing module and paste the "redirectTo:'path'" and "pathMatch:'full'" in the routes array

Example:-
{path:'',redirectTo:'login',pathMatch:'full'},

the above code will redirect the home page to login path URL 'localhost:4200/login'

this can be applied to different modules and URL can extended depending upon the redirecting path
