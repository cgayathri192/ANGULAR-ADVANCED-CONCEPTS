JIT (Just-In-Time) and AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) are
two different compilation options in Angular.

JIT:

Compiles your application in the browser at runtime.
Provides fast development experiences and diagnostics, as the compiler is available at runtime.
This is the default compilation mode when you use the
			ng serve command.


AOT:

Compiles your application ahead of time, before the browser loads it.
The compiled code is optimized for faster startup and better runtime performance, compared to JIT.
This is the default compilation mode when you use the
		ng build --prod

In summary, AOT is used in production while JIT is used in development.
