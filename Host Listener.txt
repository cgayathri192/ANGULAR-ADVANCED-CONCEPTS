In Angular, @HostListener is a decorator that is used to listen to events on the host element of a directive or a component. The host element refers to the DOM element to which the directive or component is attached. @HostListener allows you to define event handlers within your directive or component's code, which will be executed when the specified event occurs on the host element.

The syntax for using @HostListener is as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@HostListener(eventName: string, args?: string[])

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

where eventName is the name of the event you want to listen for, and args (optional) is an array of arguments to be passed to the event handler function.

Here's an example of how you can use @HostListener in an Angular directive:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

import { Directive, HostListener } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[myDirective]'
})
export class MyDirective {
  constructor() { }

  @HostListener('click', ['$event'])
  onClick(event: Event): void {
    console.log('Clicked!', event);
    // Your logic here
  }
}

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the example above, @HostListener is used to listen for a click event on the host element, and the onClick method is the event handler that will be executed when the click event occurs. The $event parameter is used to pass the event object to the event handler function, which can be used to access event details such as target element, event type, etc.
