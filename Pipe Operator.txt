The pipe operator in RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is used to chain together multiple operators in a functional way.
It allows you to pass the output of one operator as the input to the next, creating a series of transformations on the data.
The pipe operator can simplify the code and make it more readable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

import { map, filter } from 'rxjs/operators';

source$.pipe(
  filter(x => x % 2 === 0),
  map(x => x * x)
).subscribe(x => console.log(x));

In this example, the filter operator is used to only allow even numbers to pass, and then the map operator is used to square those numbers.
The result of this transformation is then passed to the subscribe method, which is used to observe the final values.
