RxJS is a library for reactive programming in JavaScript.
It provides a powerful set of tools for working with asynchronous data streams, such as observables, subjects, and operators.

In Angular, RxJS is used extensively to manage asynchronous data and events.
Observables are used to handle asynchronous data, such as data coming from a server over an HTTP request.
Subjects are used to broadcast data to multiple subscribers.
Operators are used to transform and filter data streams.
