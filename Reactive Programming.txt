what is Reactive Programming?

->our app will react to change and handle data streams rather than we writing each event handling seperately

-> Reactive Programming is an asynchrnous programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change
-> RxJS is a library for reactive programming using observables that makes it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code

in simple terms:

-> Reactive programming is just a different way of building software applications.
-> Essentially, our software is built to "react" to changes that happen(like click events, data being fetched,etc instead of the typical way of writing software where we explicitly write code(aka "imperative programming) to handle changes.


->RxJS is a library which helps us in making async calls and implement callback mechanisms easily using observables

->RxJS mainly consists of 3 things

	- Observable
	- Satelite Data Types - Observables, Schedulers,Subjects
	- Operators
		-Array Methods
			-Map
			-Filter
			-Reduce

-> Observable
	- Its a data stream

Ex:- -In a ecommerce shopping cart application
		-orderStatus value-Null
		-user comes and places an order
			-order status will change over time // continously changing
				-orderStatus = order placed
				-orderStatus = order received
				-orderStatus = order processing
				-orderStatus = order submitted
				-orderStatus = order completed
			- needs to be informed to multiple apps
-> Subscriber
	- It will listen to the Observable for data changes/updates
