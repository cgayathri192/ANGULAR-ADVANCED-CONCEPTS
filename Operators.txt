Operators

-> Operators are very important part of RxJS
-> RxJS library provides a lot of useful operators which helps us write clean code and reduce lot of effort in writing custom logic-which leads to many bugs actually!

-> Operator is a pure function

-> What is a pure function?
	- a function will also return same value when passed with same input value
	- has no side effects

-> Operator takes in observables as input and output will also be an observable
