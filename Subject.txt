In Angular, a subject is a special type of observable that allows you to broadcast data to multiple subscribers.
Subjects are similar to regular observables,
but they have the ability to multicast, meaning they can send their data to multiple subscribers.

Here's an example of how you might use a subject in an Angular component:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

import { Subject } from 'rxjs';

@Component({
  // ...
})
export class MyComponent {
  dataSource = new Subject<number>();

  constructor() {}

  addData(data: number) {
    this.dataSource.next(data);
  }
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the example above, we have created a new subject called dataSource using the Subject class from the rxjs library.
The next() method is used to send new data to the subscribers of the subject.

To subscribe to the subject, you can use the subscribe() method and provide a callback function:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

this.dataSource.subscribe(data => {
  // Process the data
});

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The callback function passed to the subscribe() method will be called whenever new data is emitted by the subject.

Subjects are useful for situations where you want to broadcast data to multiple subscribers, such as in a publish-subscribe pattern.
They are a powerful tool for building reactive and event-driven applications in Angular.
