1.Install JSON Server 
	->Since JSON Server is available as an NPM package,
	  we can perform the installation by using the Node.js package manager.

command ->		npm install json-server

2.Create a sample json file with data

JSON Server will take a JSON file from your main project folder and
turn it into a RESTful database with all the right routes.
It can even do things like search queries.

I have created a json file db.json inside my newly created project


3.Running the server
it can done in two ways.

Direct Command execution
	->Start JSON server by executing the following command
	->json-server â€“watch db.json

Adding json file manually in package.json
	->In package.json, add the below code to run json-server with short code.
	->"json:server": "json-server --watch db.json",
	->now run the server with command (npm run json:server)

4.Your JSON Server will be running on port 3000.
  The below data will be shown in the terminal

Resources
http://localhost:3000

 
Now you can click on the posts link in the page,
which will show the JSON data given in db.json
file now that we have our server and API running.

Test it with a tool like POSTMAN.
Initiate a HTTP GET request to http://localhost:3000/posts
